**Description:**  
Website based on the Jekyll theme [Minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima).  
Generated with [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) and hosted by
[Github](https://github.com/) and versioned
[there](https://github.com/leonardSA/leonardsa.github.io) as well.  
The font is IBM's [IBM-Plex-Mono](https://github.com/IBM/plex).  
Theme slightly modified by me and this page was also generated using a python 
script of mine.
